# CQL_POC

This is a POC/reference implementation of CQL Editor. Ideas tried out here in this code might be used inside MAT in future.
Users of this repo should not make any assumptions about all the features here making it inside MAT.

Essentially, this is a ACE Editor with a new mode (CQL) mode added. The CQL mode has CQL keywords, 
some frequently used expressions, QDM datatype names, and attributes, etc.

Ctrl + Space will give you all the keywords.
Ctrl+Shift+T will give you all the timings.
Ctrl+shift+F will give you all the functions.
